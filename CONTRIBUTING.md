# Contributing to `cff-reader-java`

**Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project!**

Contributions are very welcome! 

They can, for example, take the form of [issue reports](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cff-reader-java/issues/new), which are a great way of alerting the community about bugs, or suggesting new features.

If you want to contribute code to the project, please [create an issue first](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cff-reader-java/issues/new) to discuss what changes you plan to make. Usually, the best way to contribute code that has been agreed upon is by pull request: [Fork the repository](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cff-reader-java/issues#fork-destination-box), make your changes and push them to your fork (ideally to a branch named after the issue, e.g., `fix-123`), and then [create a pull request](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cff-reader-java/compare) for this branch. Pull requests should always target the `develop` branch on the original (i.e., this) repository.
